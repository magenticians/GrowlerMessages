# GrowlerMessages - Magento Extension

*This repository accompanies the following tutorial: [Growl-like notifications in the Magento backend](http://magenticians.com/growler-magento-backend)*

A **proof-of-concept** Magento Extension which will replace standard Magento messages with [Growler](http://code.google.com/p/kproto/wiki/Growler) notifications in your Magento back-end. Drag-and-drop on top of your Magento installation.

Unless you want to "pimp your backend", this code should probably not be used in production.
